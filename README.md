These scripts are for managing program committee meetings. They are
designed to read CSV files exported from HotCRP and produce meeting
schedules that minimize traffic due to conflicts of interest.

# How to use these scripts

First, you have to build the scripts. You'll need Haskell and some packages. I've only tested on GHC 7.8.3.

```
$ make
ghc ordering.hs -main-is Ordering -o ordering
[1 of 2] Compiling Util             ( Util.hs, Util.o )
[2 of 2] Compiling Ordering         ( ordering.hs, ordering.o )
Linking ordering ...
ghc slides.hs -main-is Slides -o slides
[2 of 2] Compiling Slides           ( slides.hs, slides.o )
Linking slides ...
```

There are two scripts: ordering and slides, to be run in that order.

```
$ ./ordering papers.csv conflicts.csv pc.csv >schedule.csv
$ ./slides schedule.csv pc.csv >slides.tex
$ pdflatex slides.tex
```

The first command generates a schedule on stdout, which is redirected
here to schedule.csv. The schedule file output by `ordering` has a format like...

```
17,foo@bar.com,blah@bargle.com,professor@very.important.edu
25,foo@bar.com,blah@bargle.com
```

...where the initial number is the paper under discussion and the
emails are those of conflicted PC members. The slides generated by
`slides` use LaTeX/Beamer to produce a schedule indicating the current
paper under discussion and the two upcoming papers.

# Silly questions

## Why is it two programs?

Because you might want to edit the schedule by hand, e.g., to put
specific papers first or last.

## Is it really optimal?

No, I use a simple greedy algorithm: pick a paper as the "first"
paper; the next paper is one with minimal overlap; and so on. I try
this with every possible first paper and choose the best.

## What's with the 'test' make target? It doesn't work.

I'm lazy. I tested on real data, which shouldn't be put up in
public. If I am ever truly bored, I'll cons up some sanitized test
data.
